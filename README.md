  sudo apt install git -y
  ```

  - Download repo
  ```bash
  cd
  git clone https://github.com/OnyxJeff/pp4-skadi.git
  ```

```bash
cd ~/pp4-skadi/U6143_ssd1306
chmod +x setup_display_service.sh
sudo ./setup_display_service.sh
```

- Custom display temperature type
  - Open the U6143_ssd1306/C/ssd1306_i2c.h file. You can modify the value of the TEMPERATURE_TYPE variable to change the type of temperature displayed. (The default is Fahrenheit)

## 📦 Updating and Installing Docker Compose

- Update and Upgrade the System via script:
```bash
cd ~/pp4-skadi/scripts
chmod +x apt-get-autoupdater.sh
sudo ./apt-get-autoupdater.sh
```

- Start CronJob (optional but recommended if doing headless/always on installation)
```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

add the following to the bottom of the document:
```bash
# OS-Auto-Updater
  00 01 * * 0 bash $HOME/pp4-skadi/scripts/apt-get-autoupdater.sh
    # execute automatic update script and log every sunday at 01:00 am
  50 00 1 * * /bin/bash -c 'cp $HOME/pp4-skadi/logs/apt-get-autoupdater.log $HOME/pp4-skadi/backup_logs/apt-get-autoupdater-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).log'
    # saves monthly version of "apt-get-autoupdater.log" on the 1st of every month at 00:50 am
  51 00 1 * * rm -f $HOME/pp4-skadi/logs/apt-get-autoupdater.log
    # deletes old weekly log on the 1st of every month at 00:51 am
```

- Install Docker
```bash
cd
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

```bash
sudo apt install docker-compose-plugin
```

- Verify Installation:
```bash
docker run hello-world
docker compose version
